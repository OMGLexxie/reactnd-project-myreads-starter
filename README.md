## How to Launch

Download or clone the github repository. Then navigate into the project directory and run "npm install" to install all dependencies. Once "npm install" is complete, run "npm start" to spin up the local server, be default at localhost:3000. You should be taken to this page within your default browser, but can always navigate to localhost:3000 manually if necessary. To close the local server, simply close the browser window or use "Ctrl+C" or "Command+C" within the  terminal.

## Dependencies

Browser support for HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript with ES6.
Running "npm install" in the project directory
